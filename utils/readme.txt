Utils

A selection of miscellaneous utilities, for doing various boring tasks.


cvarray.py - Code for converting between open cv and numpy arrays.

prog_bar.py - A simple progress bar object, for command line interface feedback.

mp_map.py - A multiprocess map. Note that this file contains unit tests.

setprocName.py - Function to change the process name of a python program.

make.py - A wrapper around distutils for making modules when they have changed. Its a bit like scipy.weave, except you write a real module and it just compiles it on demand for the current platform.


start_cpp.py - Helper to add line numbers to scipy.weave code, to make the error messages helpful.

numpy_help_cpp.py - Helper functions for accessing numpy arrays in scipy.weave.

python_obj_cpp.py - Helper functions for manipulating python objects in scipy.weave.

gamma_cpp.py - Implimentations of the Gamma and related functions in C.

matrix_cpp.py - Some matrix operations in C++.


readme.txt - This file, which is copied into the html documentation.

make_doc.py - code that generates the html documentation.
